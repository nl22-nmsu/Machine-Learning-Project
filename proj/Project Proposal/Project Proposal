Problem Definition: Wind estimation using KNN algorithm

Motivation: Vertical Take Off and Landing UAS wind estimation is very difficult due to the propellers causing a down-wash effect. 
Air-speed sensors are also very inaccurate and add unecessary weight to the UAS. If a learning algorithm is able to observe the UAS 
motion and the controller input values, a prediction of the air-speed can be made and used to better stabalize the UAS. 

Approach: We will use a KNN algorithm to predict the airspeed by determining an optimal k value. By averaging the values of the k neighbors 
of a new data point together, the wind speed can be predicted.
