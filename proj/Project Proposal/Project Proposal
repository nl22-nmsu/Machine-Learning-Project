Problem Definition: Task Allocation
Optimally assign N agents to N tasks in centralized assignment scheme using a Machine Learning algorithm.

Motivating scenario:
Amazon drone delivery optimization.

If there exists N distributions facilities each with only one drone (for this example) that can fulfill N orders, we want to have each
distribution facility decide on which order to fulfill while minimizing the distance traveled by each drone.
